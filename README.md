1. Add event listener to Learn more button
    This should send a get request to /id endpoint
    Display the element to the DOM 

2. Limit the initial get request on page load to 5 -- And have these in the featured DIV -- Done 

3. Add event listener to See more Businesses
    This should send a get request for all of the businesses to be rendered in a different format 

    --Kinda done but businesses should be rendered in a different div than the div that's only showing 5 

4. On the show page -- there should be a form to fill out an investment amount and then create a new investment in the DB 

5. Once a new investment is created -- it should affect the goal number for the business  -- BACKEND 

6. Create the nav bar 
    'Revive NY' text will go to homepage
    'Lend' text will go to see more businesses 
    'Sign in' will go to a page for signing in

7. Might need to make a percent funded -- Whatever percentage you have funded should be a percentage of the shading of the bar
